## Predicting House Prices in King County, USA
This project explores building a model to estimate house prices in King County, Washington using the King County House Sales dataset from Kaggle. It analyzes how features like square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms, location, etc. correlate with price.

**Key Aspects:**
* Uses relevant features like size, amenities, location to predict price 
* Implements analysis and modeling in Jupyter Notebook with Python
* Tries linear regression and feature engineering techniques
* Evaluates models using metrics like R-squared, MSE, RMSE

**Current Status:** 
* Initial model shows promise but needs refinement
* Ongoing work focuses on handling outliers, biases, and improving accuracy

**Usage:**
1. Download the repository 
2. Open house_price_prediction.ipynb notebook in Jupyter
3. Follow along and customize the code

**More Details:**
* Data source: kaggle datasets download -d harlfoxem/housesalesprediction
* Tools: Python, Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn

**Next Steps:**
* Further analyze and handle outliers and biases
* Try different models to improve performance 
* Explore feature engineering for richer data
