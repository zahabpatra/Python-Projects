# Employee Turnover Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict employee turnover using machine learning techniques. Employee turnover, or attrition, is a key challenge faced by many organizations. By analyzing the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, we seek to identify patterns and factors that contribute to employee turnover and build a model to predict which employees are most likely to leave the company.

## Key Aspects
- Uses relevant features from the dataset to predict attrition
- Implements analysis and modeling in Jupyter Notebook with Python
- Tries a Random Forest classifier for prediction
- Evaluates models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## Current Status
- Initial model shows promise but needs refinement
- Ongoing work focuses on improving accuracy and generalizability
- Future improvements include exploring additional features and models

## Usage
