## Predicting Employee Attrition

### Summary
The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict employee turnover using machine learning techniques. Employee turnover, also known as attrition, is a major challenge for many companies. By examining the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset, we aim to identify patterns and factors that lead to employee turnover and develop a model to predict which employees are most likely to leave.

### Key Points  
- Leverages relevant attributes from the dataset to forecast attrition   
- Implements data analysis and modeling in Python using Jupyter Notebook
- Attempts a Random Forest classifier to make predictions  
- Evaluates models utilizing metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score

### Status  
- Initial model shows potential but requires refinement
- Ongoing efforts focus on enhancing accuracy and generalizability 
- Future work includes exploring additional features and models

### Usage
- Download the repository 
- Open the employee_turnover.ipynb notebook in Jupyter
- Follow along and adapt the code
