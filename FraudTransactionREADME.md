# Detecting Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions

## Summary  
This project focuses on identifying potentially fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. By examining the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle, we aim to build a model that can detect deceitful transactions and help prevent financial losses for card companies and users.

## Key Points
- Applies various machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier
- Manages imbalanced classes using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)  
- Evaluates model performance with metrics including accuracy, AUC-ROC, precision, and recall

## Data  
The dataset utilized in this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) dataset from Kaggle. It has 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

## Status  
- Initial model shows potential but requires refinement
- Ongoing efforts focus on enhancing accuracy and generalizability 
- Future plans include exploring more features and models

## Usage
- Download the repository
- Open fraud_transaction.ipynb notebook in Jupyter
- Follow along and customize the code
